# On-Chain Portfolio Builder – Showcase Course Completions

## 📝 Project Title
**On-Chain Portfolio Builder – Showcase Course Completions**

## 📘 Project Description
This project is a simple Clarity-based smart contract that enables users to **stake tokens to showcase their course completion on-chain**. By staking any positive amount, a learner permanently marks that they have completed a course. Their participation is then queryable on-chain as proof of completion.

## 🚀 Project Vision
The goal is to build an **on-chain reputation and credential system** for educational platforms. Each course completion is stored immutably on-chain, providing decentralized, verifiable proof that can be used in applications such as portfolios, employer checks, or DAO governance eligibility.

## 🌱 Future Scope
- Integrate with NFT badges for each course completion.
- Enable course-specific staking and un-staking logic.
- Build a UI to showcase completed courses on a user’s on-chain profile.
- Connect to off-chain learning platforms via Oracles.
- Implement rewards for course completions (e.g., token/NFT airdrops).
